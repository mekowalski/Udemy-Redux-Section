General Data-Loading with Redux

-Every time data needs to be loaded from an outside API, it will almost always be the exact same flow

1. Component gets rendered onto screen
  eg: PostList comp getting a list of posts from external API

2. Component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method gets called
  eg: Because of PostList getting list from external API and it is called on a class-based component

3. Call Action Creator from `componentDidMount`
4. Action Creator runs code to make API request
5. API responds with data
