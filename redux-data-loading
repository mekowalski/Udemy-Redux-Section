General Data-Loading with Redux

-Every time data needs to be loaded from an outside API, it will almost always be the exact same flow

1. Component gets rendered onto screen
  -PostList comp getting a list of posts from external API

2. Component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method gets called
  -Because of PostList getting list from external API and it is called on a class-based component

3. Call Action Creator from `componentDidMount`
  -When PostList initially renders, the Action Creator will be called

4. Action Creator runs code to make API request
  -Will use Axios to make API requests over to external API

5. API responds with data
  -The list of blog posts(example)

6. Action Creator returns and Action with fetched data on Payload property

7. A Reducer sees the Action, returns the data off the Payload

8. New State object is generated, Redux/React-Redux cause React app tp re-render
