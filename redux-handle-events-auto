AUTOMATICALLY HANDLING EVENTS
-Field component itself doesn't actually know how show a text input
 (or dropdown, checkbox or any type of form element)

-Need to assign a prop, called component, to Field in order to show actual text on screen
-Either a React component or a function for Field to call
-This component needs to return some element to actually be shown on screen
  eg: <Field name='title' component={} />

***All about hooking up infrastructure of Store to mapStateToProps to Props to Handler to Action Creator
back to Store cycle***

-Lesson to learn:
  1. Redux Form is all about automating the entire process(handling inputs)
  2. EOD, RF doesn't really know a lot about what's being done
    -Doesn't know if a text input it showing, or if a dropdown/checkbox is being shown
    -RF will assume I (developer) is doing the right thing
  3. In order to do the correct 'thing', supposed to return an input element via helper method passed to
    component prop in Field
    eg: helper mehthod
    renderInput() {
      return (
        <input />
      )
    }

    <Field name='title' component={this.renderInput} />
