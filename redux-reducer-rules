-In previous application, all the reducers were created in a single reducers/index.js file

-This time, create a separate file for each Reducer needed
-As projects are larger, separating the reducers will help clarify purpose
eg:
  Action Creators
    fetchPosts    --->    Action
                      type: 'FETCH_POSTS'
                      payload: response     --->    Store
                                                  Reducers
                                                  postsReducer: Maintain array of all fetched posts

a. Action Creator will fetch the post
b. An Action will be dispatched with type: FETCH_POSTS and response on payload proertys
c. Create a postsReducer to watch for actions of FETCH_POSTS, pull off response & add it into an array
