***NOT RELATED TO UDEMY, JUST GOOD, SIMPLE ORGANIZATION FOR THIS NOTE FILE***

Goals:

[x] Establish app idea, a domain, need to perform CRUD
  -IDEAS
    - calendar? tasks?
    - coffee drinks log? like maybe steps on how to create a latte/americano/steamer/etc
    - birthday keeper? store peoples' bdays and attach sign/birthstone/gift memos/etc
    - music playlist? obviously create playlists/add songs/delete playlists or songs
    - clothing store? sell your clothes/description/prices/maybe photo(s) of clothes (complicated?)
    - (alcohol) drink app? recipe for popular drinks/comments on those drinks/sort by type?
    GOING WITH COFFEE DRINKS

[x] Create user stories
  -Overview
  Build coffee drinks app that lists coffee drinks, allows users to add coffee drinks and notes on them

  -User Story: User should be able to:
  1. look up coffee drinks
  2. add coffee drinks they've had
  3. leave notes on the coffee drinks they've had
  4. look for coffee drinks they haven't had
  5. maybe add WHERE they've had coffee drinks? (so much thinking)
  6. have favorite coffee drinks or cafes?
  7. DEFINITELY sign up and log in (optional)(maybe just hardcode a user first, myself!)

[] Models and Relationships
  - Coffee: name, hot/iced/other(type?), beanRoast(regular/blonde/dark?)
    -Relationship: belongs to User, has many Notes

  - User: name, username, password
    -Relationship: has many Coffee, has many Notes, has many Locations/Cafes

  - Location/Cafes: name, city, state
    -Relationship: belongs to Coffee, belongs to User

  - Notes: content
    -Relationship: belongs to User, belongs to Coffee

    ***is this all making sense?***

[] Build Rails API back end
[] Add serializers

//IF all the above is accomplished, maybe start framing app layout on front end
//such as what kind of components needed or will be used
[] Use create-react-app, begin scaffold front end
[] Maybe create Redux store
