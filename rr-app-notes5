Goals:

[] Establish app idea, a domain
[] Create user stories
[] Models and Relationships
[] Build Rails API back end
[] Add serializers

//IF all the above is accomplished, maybe start framing app layout on front end
//such as what kind of components needed or will be used
[] Use create-react-app, begin scaffold front end
[] Maybe create Redux store
