***NOT RELATED TO UDEMY, JUST GOOD, SIMPLE ORGANIZATION FOR THIS NOTE FILE***

Goals:

[x] Establish app idea, a domain, need to perform CRUD
  -IDEAS
    - calendar? tasks?
    - coffee drinks log? like maybe steps on how to create a latte/americano/steamer/etc
    - birthday keeper? store peoples' bdays and attach sign/birthstone/gift memos/etc
    - music playlist? obviously create playlists/add songs/delete playlists or songs
    - clothing store? sell your clothes/description/prices/maybe photo(s) of clothes (complicated?)
    - (alcohol) drink app? recipe for popular drinks/comments on those drinks/sort by type?
    GOING WITH COFFEE DRINKS

[x] Create user stories
  -Overview
  Build coffee drinks app that lists coffee drinks, allows users to add coffee drinks and notes on them

  -User Story: User should be able to:
  1. look up coffee drinks
  2. add coffee drinks they've had
  3. leave notes on the coffee drinks they've had
  4. look for coffee drinks they haven't had
  5. maybe add WHERE they've had coffee drinks? (so much thinking)
  6. have favorite coffee drinks or cafes?
  7. DEFINITELY sign up and log in (optional)(maybe just hardcode a user first, myself!)

[x] Models and Relationships
  - User: name, username, password
    -Relationship: has_many Coffee, has_many Notes, has_many Locations/Cafes, through: Coffee

  - Coffee: name, hot/iced/other(type?), beanRoast(regular/blonde/dark?), milk?, syrup?
    -Relationship: belongs_to User, has_many Notes

  - Location/Cafes: name, city, state
    -Relationship: belongs_to Coffee, belongs_to User

  - Notes: date, content
    -Relationship: belongs_to User, belongs_to Coffee

    ***is this all making sense?***

    EXAMPLE:
    User: me, myself and i
    Coffee: Vanilla Latte, hot, with regular espresso, coconut milk and vanilla syrup
    Location: Artifacts Gallery, Farmington, New Mexico
    Notes: 090119, The latte was smooth, due to the coconut milk, I think.  The temperature was perfect
      for a beginning start to the autumn season.  The vanilla wasn't too sweet, great compliment to the
      espresson.
      

[] Build Rails API back end

[] Add serializers

//IF all the above is accomplished, maybe start framing app layout on front end
//such as what kind of components needed or will be used
[] Use create-react-app, begin scaffold front end
[] Maybe create Redux store
