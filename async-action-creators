Understanding Async Action Creators

What's wrong with fetchPosts?
-Action creators must return plain JS objects with a type property
*this is currently not happening*

-By the time the action gets to a reducer, data won't have been fetched


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN APP RUNS(currently)

PostList
componentDidMount() {
  this.props.fetchPosts()
}           ------------>   Probably happening
                              in React-Redux
                            store.dispatch(
                              fetchPosts()
                            )     ------------>     actions/index.js
