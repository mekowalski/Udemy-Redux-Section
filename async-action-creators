Understanding Async Action Creators

What's wrong with fetchPosts?
-Action creators must return plain JS objects with a type property
*this is currently not happening*

-By the time the action gets to a reducer, data won't have been fetched


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN APP RUNS(currently)

PostList
componentDidMount() {
  this.props.fetchPosts()
}           ------------>   Probably happening
                              in React-Redux
                            store.dispatch(
                              fetchPosts()
                            )     ------------>     actions/index.js
                                                  export const fetchPosts = async () => {
                                                    const response = await jsonPlaceholder.get('/posts');

                                                    return {
                                                      type: 'FETCH_POSTS',
                                                      payload: response
                                                    };
                                                  }

What may seem to bee occurring
-PostList Component lifecycle method, anytime it's invoked, it calls this.props.fetchPosts()
-Probably behind the scenes, dispatch is being called
  -everytime an action creator is called, it returns an action which is sent to dispatch on redux Store
-React-Redux is probably calling the action creator function of fetchPosts()
-React-Redux probably calls the fetchPosts() function
-A request is made from within, and then waiting occurs
-Then an object is returned


What is ACTUALLY happening
-componentDidMount gets called which calls fetchPosts
-That then calls an imaginary code inside React-Redux library(store.dispatch())
-Action creator gets called and invoked
-Then at some point in time, come across 'return jsonPlaceholder.get('/posts')' THE REQUEST OBJECT
-Not the ACTION OBJECT 'return { type: 'FETCH_POSTS', payload: response }'
