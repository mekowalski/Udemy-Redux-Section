1. Story(analogy) to help understand Redux
2. Write some Redux-only code
3. Work on a React App
4. Understand how to integrate React with Redux


REDUX CYCLE
Action Creator ---> Action ---> Dispatch ---> Reducers ---> State

ONE
-Lets build and insurance company!
Policy: Customer holds a 'policy', if bad stuff happens to them then we pay them
Claim: Customer has something bad happen to them, we need to pay them
***These are insurance terms, NOT Redux terms***

                                                        INSURANCE CO
                                                        |          |
                                              | --->  FORM    Claims History
CUSTOMER ---> FORM --->  FORM RECEIVER  --->  |
                                              | --->  FORM    Policies
                                              |
                                              | --->  FORM    Accounting

DEPARTMENTS
-Claims History: List of all claims ever made
-Policies: List of who has a policy with the insurance company
-Accounting: Stores a big bag of cash, the customers pay for this


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A NEW CUSTOMER WANTS TO SIGN UP FOR A NEW POLICY
Policy is a contract that covers the customer
a. Customer fills out a form for a Policy
b. Customer goes to Insurance Company HQ
c. They won't just go to one of the Departments to hand in the form
d. Customer has to take it to a front office/counter and give it to the Form Receiver
e. Form Receiver makes a copy of the Form
f. Then those copies will be handed off to each department inside the HQ

*The purpose of the first Form is to sign up for a new Policy
*Claims History probably doesn't care about a New Policy Form, they just record list of claims
*New Customer signing up for a new Policy will most likely be in touch with Policies Department


FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
What happens when a Form is handed off to a specific Department?
-Policies Dept is in charge for all who hold Policies
-They will see new Customer wanting new Policy and decide to add them

                                          POLICIES DEPARTMENT
                                      List of Customers w/ Policies

          Form to sign up                         Malind
            for a new      --------->              Ryan
             Policy                             Kristopher
                                                 Christine

MANAGEMENT TEAM: Tell me a list of who has a Policy right now!
-They will get frustrated with going to Policies Dept to get Policy information
-Instead of Policies Dept storing/managing the Policies
-The Policies will be stored inside a central Company Data Bank stored outside the Departments
-Now the Management Team can easily access any of the Departments without having to go to each Dept
-To update the Policies in the Data Bank, Form Receiver will go to both Policies Dept and Data Bank
-Policies Dept will look at new Form, process it and pass it back to the Data Bank
