CONNECT
-Connect is a React Component that is provided from React
-Connect communicates with Provider to retrieve data from the store
-Through the Context system, a Parent Component is able to directly communicate with a Child component
1. Connect will ask Provider for Data from the Store
2. Provider will return the current Data
3. Connect takes the Data and passes it as a Prop to the respective Component(that needs the Data)
4. Connect will show Data of both State and Action Creators in the component as Props

eg: a Component
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class ThisComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        This is a Component
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default connect()(ThisComponent)

*connect(): returns a function
*(ThisComponent): invokes the function


CONFIGURE CONNECT CALL WITH MAPSTATETOPROPS
-Get info from Store via the Provider
-Any time the Data in the Store changes, the Provider will automatically notify Connect function
-This also will ensure that the respective Component has the current/updated Data from Connect
