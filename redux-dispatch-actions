HANDLE THE RESPONSE COMING BACK FROM POST(method) REQUEST

-The response contains the actual saved record of creation
  eg: actions/createStream (ORIGINAL)
  export const createStream = (formValues) => {
    return async (dispatch) => {
      streams.post('/streams', formValues)
    }
  }


-Handle on the stream that was just created
  eg: actions/createStream (MODIFIED)
  export const createStream = (formValues) => {
    return async (dispatch) => {
      const response = await streams.post('/streams', formValues)
    }
  }


DISPATCH AN ACTION WITH A TYPE & PAYLOAD OF THE RESPONSE

Step ONE:
-Need to have a new, constant type
  eg: actions/types.js
  //constant type
  //constant type
  export const CREATE_STREAM = 'CREATE_STREAM';


Step TWO:
-Import new constant type into actions/index.js
  eg: actions/index.js
  //import statement
> import { SIGN_IN, SIGN_OUT, CREATE_STREAM } from './types'


Step THREE:
-In the Action Creator, after getting the response
-Dispatch the action with a type and payload
  eg: actions/index/js #createStream
  export const createStream = (formValues) => {
    return async (dispatch) => {
      const response = await streams.post('/streams', formValues)

      dispatch({ type: CREATE_STREAM, payload: response.data })
    }
  }
  ***response.data, returned from axios, the response object has a ton of properties but .data is the only
  one necessary for application***
