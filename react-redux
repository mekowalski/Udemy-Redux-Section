*high-level overview*

1. Using React-Redux, create 2 new components(Provider and Connect)
2. Both components created by React-Redux, that I will create instances of
3. Pass some Props into both to configure how they work

-Store Contains the Reducers and State of application
-Store will be passed as a prop to the Provider
-Provider is rendered at the top of the app hierarchy
