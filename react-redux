HOW DOES REACT AND REDUX FIT TOGETHER

            STORE
          Reducers
      Song list reducer     --------->    Provider
    Selected song reducer                     |
                                              |
                                             App
                                              |
                                              |
      ACTION CREATORS                      Connect  <---  Communicates with Provider
       Select Song                            |
                                              |
                                          SongList

*high-level overview*

1. Using React-Redux, create 2 new components(Provider and Connect)
2. Both components created by React-Redux, that I will create instances of
3. Pass some Props into both to configure how they work

-Store Contains the Reducers and State of application
-Store will be passed as a prop to the Provider

-Provider is rendered at the top of the app hierarchy
  -The App will be shown inside the Provider
-Provider also will have reference to the Store
  -Essentially provides information to different parts of the application
-After provider is wired up, need to somehow access the Data inside the Store
-Connect will wrap SongList component
  -It communicates with Provider tag at the hierarchy
  -Not communicated through Props system but through the Context system
  -Context system allows communication directly from Parent component to Child component even if other
   components are between them(such as App)
