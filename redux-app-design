-Class-based Components are used anytime State needs to be used
-With Redux, component-level State is used much less
-Instead, State will be generally stored inside Redux

1. How to design Redux side of App
2. How to organize Project Directory
3. Where to create Action Creators, Reducers and Actions, etc


REACT WITHOUT REDUX
                        App
                         |
                     Song List
                   Selected Songs
                         |
                   ------|------
                   |           |
              Song List     Selected
            onSongSelect      Song
                   |           |
              SongList      SongDetail


REACT WITH REDUX

      REDUCERS                              APP
  Song list reducer                          |
Selected song reducer                 ------ | ------
                                      |             |
  ACTION CREATORS                 SongList       SongDetail
   Select Song

-App will pass very little information down to the Child Components
-Instead all the ideas of song creation, selection and current selection is in the Redux of app
-Reducers
1. A reducer for a list of songs
  -This will pass in a static array of songs
  -Maintain it through the reducer(this is not ideal but just practice)
2. A reducer to record currently selected song

-Action Creators
1. Select song that will dispatch an action, tell the reducer to update data and reflect the new, current
   picked song
