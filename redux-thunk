REDUX-THUNK: Middleware to help make requests in a Redux application
-Middleware refers to the Redux library
-Functions that slightly change the behavior of Store
-Add in new capabilities/features to Redux side
-Middleware is always used in Redux library(redux-thunk is prominent)


MIDDLEWARES IN REDUX
-Now adventuring into the world of asynchronous action creators
Synchronous Action Creator: Instantly returns an action with data ready to go
Asynchronous Action Creator: Takes some amount of time for it to get its data ready to go
  -Any time an action creator tat makes a network request, it will always qualify as asynchronous action
   creator

-To have asynchronous action creators in Redux, need to install middleware to allow this activity


MIDDLEWARE
-Plain JS function that gets called with every single Action dispatched

REDUX CYCLE(current)
Action Creator  --->  Action  --->  Dispatch  --->  Reducers  --->  State

REDUX CYCLE with REDUX
Action Creator  --->  Action  --->  Dispatch  --->  Middleware  --->  Reducers  --->  State
-When an action is dispatched, instead of sending off to reducers, actions will be sent through all the
 middlewares inside Redux app

-Can have as many or as few middlewares, current app will have 1 or 2
