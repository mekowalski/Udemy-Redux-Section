REDUX FORMS
-A bit notorious
  1. Many developers believe it's challenging to understand
  2. Though it does a ton of stuff automatically, making programming a bit easier,
     compared to putting all the different forms together by hand & integrate Redux

-Current project(streams-app) has used Class Components which has used component-level State
-This cycle went on and on and over again
  1. State object recorded current value of an element
  2. That value was taken out and pushed into the input element inside DOM(tell input what its value was)
  3. Whenever a user changed that text, onChange CB was called
  4. onChange CB would called setState method and update component-level State
