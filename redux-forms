REDUX FORMS
-A bit notorious
  1. Many developers believe it's challenging to understand
  2. Though it does a ton of stuff automatically, making programming a bit easier,
     compared to putting all the different forms together by hand & integrate Redux

-Current project(streams-app) has used Class Components which has used component-level State
-This cycle went on and on and over again
***Handling inputs without Redux***
  1. State object recorded current value of an element
  2. That value was taken out and pushed into the input element inside DOM(tell input what its value was)
  3. Whenever a user changed that text, onChange CB was called
  4. onChange CB would called setState method and update component-level State

-Once Redux is used, the component-level approach will change slightly
-With Redux, all data should be held inside Redux Store, therefore Components will no longer hold State
-Any time a user changes an element, call an Action Creator to change the data inside Redux Store


REDUX FORM AUTOMATION
-Handling inputs with Redux Form
***RF = redux form***

  REDUX STORE                             COMPONENT                       DOM    ___________
   Redux ------> RF mapStateToProps --->    Props   ------------------>  value   | Input   |
    Form                                                                         | Element |
  Reducer <------ RF Action Creator <---   Handler  <------------------ onChange |_________|
