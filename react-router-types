React-Router has 3 different types of Routers available
-The differences are the part of URL they are looking at to decide what content to show on the screen

1. BrowserRouter: Uses everything after the TLD(top-level domain: .com, .net, etc) or port as the 'path'
eg: localhost:3000/pagetwo  (/pagetwo is used as path)

2. HashRouter: Uses everything after a # as the 'path'
eg: localhost:3000/#/pagetwo  (/#/pagetwo is used as path)
-This injects a # into the URL after the port, automatically
-Additionally, navigating to another page will still include /# then /pagetwo
-This is the main difference: just reflecting the part of the URL that RR cares about after #

3. MemoryRouter: Doesn't use the URL to track navigation
eg: localhost:3000/
