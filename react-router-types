React-Router has 3 different types of Routers available
-The differences are the part of URL they are looking at to decide what content to show on the screen

1. BrowserRouter: Uses everything after the TLD(.com, .net, etc) or port as the 'path'
2. HashRouter: Uses everything after a # as the 'path'
3. MemoryRouter: Doesn't use the URL to track navigation
