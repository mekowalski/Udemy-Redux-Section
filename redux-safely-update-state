                  BAD                             GOOD
ARRAY
-Removing array
 element          state.pop()                     state.filter(element => element !=='hey')
-Adding array
 element          state.push('hola')              [...state, 'hola']
-Replacing array
 element          state[0] = 'hey'                state.map(el => el === 'hey' ? 'later' : el)
