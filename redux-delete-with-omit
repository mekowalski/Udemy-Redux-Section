DELETING PROPERTIES WITH OMIT
-How to alter an object
DELETING a property from an object
    BAD: delete state.name
    GOOD: _.omit(state, 'name')

-_omit is given from the Lodash library
-Call in _omit, pass in the State object as first argument
-The second argument passed in would be the key that needs to be removed
***in this case with the streams-app, ID is the key used, therefore the 2nd argument passed in would be
the ID of the stream***


-When deleting a record, the Action Creator, is dispatching an Action with the id on the payload property
-Before, the payload would contain the entire record(stream) object
-But with DELETE, it's a bit different, there is payload with only the ID by itself

1. Install Lodash
npm install --save lodash

2. Wire an _omit statement inside the Reducer
eg: in a Reducer's switch expression
  export default (state = {}, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      //case statement
      //case statement

      case DELETE_STREAM:
      return _.omit(state, action.payload)

      //default
    }
  }


-_omit will not change the original State object, it creates a new object will all State properties that
 have been altered/removed/added
