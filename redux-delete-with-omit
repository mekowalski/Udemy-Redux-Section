DELETING PROPERTIES WITH OMIT
-How to alter an object
DELETING a property from an object
    BAD: delete state.name
    GOOD: _.omit(state, 'name')

-_omit is given from the Lodash library
-Call in _omit, pass in the State object as first argument
-The second argument passed in would be the key that needs to be removed
***in this case with the streams-app, ID is the key used***
