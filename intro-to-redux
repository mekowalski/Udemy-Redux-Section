INTRODUCTIONS TO REDUX
REDUX: state management library
-Same state in class-based components
-Instead of React taking care of state, extract it to the Redux library
-Makes creating complex applications a bit easier(not necessary with all React apps but is helpful)
-Not required to create a React app
-Not explicitly designed to work with react

*React is all about rendering the display onto the screen and handling user interactions
*Not really about maintaining/handling data
