OAuth-Based Authentication with Google OAuth2 Flow

EMAIL/PASSWORD AUTH
1. Store record in database with user's email and password
2. When user tries to login, compare email/password with what's stored in database
3. A user 'logs in' when they enter correct email/password

OAUTH AUTHENTICATION
1. User authenticates with outside service provider(Google, LinkedIn, Twitter)
2. User authorizes the app to access their information
3. Outside provider tells app about the user
4. App decides to trust outside provider to correctly handle user identification
5. OAuth can be used for (1) user ID in app and (2) app making actions on behalf of user

HOW TO USE OAUTH FLOW TO MAKE ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF USER
-Every time a user goes through OAuth Flow the App will ask about a list of 'scopes'
-Scopes can be anything such as: email, profile, browser history, etc
-Scope is also a permission the user grants the application
-Google OAuth Scopes: developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes


OAUTH FOR SERVERS
1. Results in token that a server can use to make requests on behalf of the user
2. Usually used when an app needs to access user data WHEN USER ISN'T LOGGED IN
3. Difficult to setup because a lot of user information needs to be stored
