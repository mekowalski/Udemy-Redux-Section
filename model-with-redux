1. Create an Action Creator: Function that returns JS object
  -Create one Action Creator for each Type of Action within the App
  -Create Policy, Create Claim and Delete Policy

2. Create an Action: JS Object that has a Type and Payload

eg: Customers dropping off a Form to Create Policy(Action Creator)
//pass in payload for custom Policy
const createPolicy = (name, amount) => {
  return { //Action: Form in Analogy
    type: 'CREATE_POLICY', //Type of Form(purpose of the Form)
    payload: { //Payload of Form(info from the body of the Form)
      name: name,
      amount: amount
    }
  }
}

eg: Delete Policy
//pass in payload for custom policy
const deletePolicy = (name) => {
  return {
    type: DELETE_POLICY,
    payload: {
      name: name
    }
  }
}

*Almost every Action Creator will look identical to both above
*Minor variations
*The complications come from understanding terminology and their purposes

eg: Create Claim
//also pass in payload
const createClaim = (name, amountToCollect) => {
  return {
    type: CREATE_CLAIM,
    payload: {
      name: name,
      amountToCollect: amountToCollect
    }
  }
}
