-Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications

-The app is really divided into 2 separate parts:
  1. the data that powers the app
  2. the views that display that data

-Separate the views in application from the data in the application

REDUX: is the data contained inside the application
  - a collection that contains all the data in the application, hard data and meta-level

REACT: is the views contained inside the application
  - displays the data with views on the screen, something the user can have interaction with

REDUX: centralizes all of the app's data into a single object, referred to as the STATE
