WIRE UP BOTH CONNECT() AND REDUXFORM
(see streams-app/streams-client/src/components/StreamCreate.js)

-Current issue: reduxForm()() is wired up similarly as connect()() would be
-How to wire up both connect and reduxForm at the same time
-Modified syntax to stack functions via a 'wrapped' variable

Step ONE: Current StreamCreate.js
  //import statements
  //import statements

  //helper methods
  //helper methods

  //handlers

  export default reduxForm({
    form: 'streamCreate',
    validate
  })(StreamCreate)
