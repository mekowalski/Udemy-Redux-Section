Overall Idea of How Redux Library Works

REDUX CYCLE
-To change the State of app, call on Action Creator
1. Action Creator: Produces an Action
2. Action: Gets fed to Dispatch
3. Dispatch: Forwards the Action to Reducers
4. Reducers: Creates new State
5. State: Will wait until it needs to be updated again
