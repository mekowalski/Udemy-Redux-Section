Overall Idea of How Redux Library Works

REDUX CYCLE
-To change the State/Data of app, call on Action Creator
1. Action Creator: Produces an Action
2. Action: Gets fed to Dispatch
3. Dispatch: Forwards the Action to Reducers
4. Reducers: Creates new State
5. State: Will wait until it needs to be updated again


COMBINEREDUCERS CALL
-Different Reducers put together are all simple functions
-Functions need to be wired together
-Making use of combineReducers wire up the Reducers altogether
-When using specific key names of the Reducer names, there ends up being a State object


DISPATCH
-Each Dispatch that is called (store.dispatch()) runs a whole Redux Cycle
-Can still modify the State object after running .dispatch with store.getState()
-At any point, Store can pull out State and read the current Data for app
