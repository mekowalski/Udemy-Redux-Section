This App may look completely complicated but it is straight forward to build
100% focus on React/Redux, not much backend pieces

BEHIND THE SCENES: Video Streaming

Streamer's Computer                  Real Time          |--->   Viewer's Browser
  Open Broadcast  ------------>  Messaging Proto- --->  |--->   Viewer's Browser
  Software(OBS)                 col(RTMP) Server        |--->   Viewer's Browser

-A streamer is running a computer that is running some streaming software(OBS is actual, real program)
-That will record the desktop and stream that video to an external server
  -RTMP server that receives an incoming video feed and broadcasts it out to many viewers
-The viewers can then watch on their browsers

-RTMP server is simple and straight forward to setup
-In a real streaming application, there is another server inside the mix
-RTMP is only about streaming videos, sole purpose
-A viewer may want to know what is currently being streamed or what stream exists inside the application
-Separate API server that stores a list of different streams/channels available within the application

-Viewer will see a list of streams available
-They then can select that stream
-This will then make a request to RTMP server to get live video feed
-Lastly the video feed will be shown on viewer's screen


STRUCTURE
-React: App will run inside viewer's browser
-Tiny API Server: This will list out all the streams/videos to watch
-RTMP Server: Responsible for handling the video streams itself

-Too many pages so I'm just going to explain those and not try to create a screen on the page
FIRST:
-There is a variety os pages/streams the viewer can visit inside the application
-The URL is going to determine what content will display on the screen
-This will show a different set of components to viewer
-There will be Navigation that will help determine what is displayed

SECOND:
-There will be Login/Logout buttons
-Will build an Authentication system into application using Google login


-This App will allow users to create unlimited channels and streams
eg: channel dedicated to programming, channel dedicated to cooking/baking, etc

-There will be different sets of rules for when a user is logged in VERSUS logged out
-LOGGED OUT:
  -User can view list of all streams/channels
  -User can view video for single stream

-LOGGED IN:
  -User can create new stream/channel
  -User can edit stream/channel they have created
  -User can delete stream/channel they have created


PAGES:
-How a user may interact with records inside an application
-Index Page:
  -List of streams for not logged in user
  -Slightly different list and options for logged in user
-Show Page:
  -Specific content to user
-Create Page: Form to create a stream
-Edit Page: Form to edit a stream
-Delete Page: Form to delete a stream
