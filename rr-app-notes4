BEHIND THE SCENES: Video Streaming

Streamer's Computer                  Real Time          |--->   Viewer's Browser
  Open Broadcast  ------------>  Messaging Proto- --->  |--->   Viewer's Browser
  Software(OBS)                 col(RTMP) Server        |--->   Viewer's Browser

-A streamer is running a computer that is running some streaming software(OBS is actual, real program)
-That will record the desktop and stream that video to an external server
  -RTMP server that receives an incoming video feed and broadcasts it out to many viewers
-The viewers can then watch on their browsers

-RTMP server is simple and straight forward to setup
-In a real streaming application, there is another server inside the mix
-RTMP is only about streaming videos, sole purpose
-A viewer may want to know what is currently being streamed or what stream exists inside the application
-Separate API server that stores a list of different streams/channels available within the application

-Viewer will see a list of streams available
-They then can select that stream
-This will then make a request to RTMP server to get live video feed
-Lastly the video feed will be shown on viewer's screen
