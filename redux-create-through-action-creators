CREATE A RECORD THROUGH ACTION CREATORS
-Any time a user submits a Form, need to attempt making a network request over to API(that i created)
1. Define Action Creator in order to make network request
2. Wire up Action Creator to Component via connect() helper
3. Call Action Creator from onSubmit() method
4. Action Creator will use Axios to make network request to API

Step ONE:
-In React App, install Axios and Redux-Thunk
-Both are used to write async Action Creator
  eg: install --save axios redux-thunk


Step TWO:
-Create new DIR: apis with File: (whatever name)
  eg: apis/records.js
-Create Axios instance
  eg: records.js
  import axios from 'axios';

  export default axios.create({
    baseURL: 'localhost:3001'  //this is the home URL that was made when i created the external API
  })
