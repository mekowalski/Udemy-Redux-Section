REST CONVENTIONS
-Standardized system for designing APIs

      ACTION        |       METHOD        |      ROUTE
____________________|_____________________|_________________
    Records List    |         GET         |     /records
  Specific record   |         GET         |   /records/:id
    Create record   |        POST         |     /records
    Update record   |         PUT         |   /records/:id
    Delete record   |       DELETE        |   /streams/:id

-System of Routes and Request Methods used to operate different Actions
  eg:
  1. to make a list of records appear on screen, make a GET request the to Route /records on the API
     server
  2. if API server follows RESTful conventions, then the API server should return an array of records
     it holds
  ***Same process for all actions with respective results***

-JSONServer, strictly adheres to REST conventions
