Why go through extra work of passing it to connect() instead of calling it in the Component

REDUX IS NOT MAGIC
-Redux does NOT automatically detect action creators being called
-Redux does NOT automatically detect a function returning an object that is an 'action'

-The Action Creator does not wire itself to Redux, it doesn't register with Redux
-When the Action Creator is imported within the Component, what is imported is a regular, plain JS function
-Action Creator can be called inside the Component but it will be treated as a normal JS function call
