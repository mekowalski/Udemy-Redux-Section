Why go through extra work of passing it to connect() instead of calling it in the Component

REDUX IS NOT MAGIC
-Redux does NOT automatically detect action creators being called
-Redux does NOT automatically detect a function returning an object that is an 'action'

-The Action Creator does not wire itself to Redux, it doesn't register with Redux
-When the Action Creator is imported within the Component, what is imported is a regular, plain JS function
-Action Creator can be called inside the Component but it will be treated as a normal JS function call
-That JS function will return an object that will not magically get forwarded to Redux
-Redux does NOT detect that a function is arbitrarily being called an Action Creator

-To make sure an Action makes its way to the Reducers, NEED to call the dispatch function
-This will return an Action object, directly passed to the store.dispatch function

eg: store.dispatch(createPolicy('Kristopher', 60));
