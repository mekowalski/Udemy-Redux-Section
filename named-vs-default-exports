-Export the Action Creator
-'export default' statement has been the primary way to export
-When multiple Action Creators are written  within a file, multiple functions may need to be exported
-Rather than create a `default export`, create a `named` export

Named Export: allows export of many functions from a single file
eg: action/index.js
export const createPolicy = (name, amount) => {
  return { //Action: Form in Analogy
    type: 'CREATE_POLICY',
    payload: {
      name: name,
      amount: amount
    }
  }
}

//Delete Policy
export const deletePolicy = (name) => {
  return {
    type: 'DELETE_POLICY',
    payload: {
      name: name
    }
  }
}



-How to import the Action Creator to another file
eg: import { selectSong } from '../actions'
-{}: means that I want to specifically import a Named export from Action Creator
-How to determine the import statement in App.js
  -If it's named export, use {}
  -If it's export default, do not use {}
