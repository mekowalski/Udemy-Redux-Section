-Solve overfetching with new action creator of `fetchPostsAndUsers()`(example)
-This solution is a bit more obvious in nature
-By creating a new Action Creator the logic executed is:
  1. First call fetchPosts
  2. Get a list of all the posts
  3. From that list, find all the unique userIds
  4. Iterate over all the unique userIds
  5. Then call fetchUser with each userId
