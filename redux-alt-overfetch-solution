-Solve overfetching with new action creator of `fetchPostsAndUsers()`(example)
-This solution is a bit more obvious in nature
-By creating a new Action Creator the logic executed is:
  1. First call fetchPosts
  2. Get a list of all the posts
  3. From that list, find all the unique userIds
  4. Iterate over all the unique userIds
  5. Then call fetchUser with each userId

-Biggest twist is that fetchPosts and fetchUser action creators won't be replaced
-fetchPostsAndUsers won't have logic to make a request to the API
-Both action creators will keep the logic of network requests
-This keeps action creators small & compact

EXAMPLE: actions/index.js
  -Revert back to original action creator
  export const fetchUser = id => {
    return async dispatch => {
      const response = await jsonPlaceholder.get(`/users/${id}`)

      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER', payload: response.data })
    }
  }

1. New action creator
eg: actions/index.js
  -Challenging part: this will call fetchPosts & fetchUser multiple times
  -All the React code, the entire application will call this action creator alone
  -No longer will call other 2 action creators
  export const fetchPostsAndUsers = () => {
    return async dispatch => {

    }
  }
