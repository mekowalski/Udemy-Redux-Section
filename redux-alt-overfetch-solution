-Solve overfetching with new action creator of `fetchPostsAndUsers()`(example)
-This solution is a bit more obvious in nature
-By creating a new Action Creator the logic executed is:
  1. First call fetchPosts
  2. Get a list of all the posts
  3. From that list, find all the unique userIds
  4. Iterate over all the unique userIds
  5. Then call fetchUser with each userId

-Biggest twist is that fetchPosts and fetchUser action creators won't be replaced
-fetchPostsAndUsers won't have logic to make a request to the API
-Both action creators will keep the logic of network requests
-This keeps action creators small & compact
