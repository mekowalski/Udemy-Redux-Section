HOW REACT-ROUTER-DOM WORKS
eg: in an App component, above the declaration
const PageOne = () => {
  return <div>Page One</div>
}

const PageTwo = () => {
  return <div>Page Two</div>
}

//here, place instance of BrowserRouter(react component)
//within BrowserRouter, pass in a Route with a path
//exact is alone
//component={} references a JS variable
//second route to reference another JS variable
//2 routers with 2 paths, 1 exact and 2 components
const App = () => {
  return (
  <div>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <Route path='/' exact component={PageOne}/>
        <Route path='/pagetwo' component={PageTwo} />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </div>
  )
}
