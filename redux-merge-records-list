MERGING A LIST OF RECORDS
-Take an array of records(streams) from API and merge it all in State object
-This is a bit more challenging
-If there was an array to work with in the Reducer, it would be straightforward to kind of 'concat' the arrays
 together

-Since it's an object that's being worked with, need a different solution

      ARRAY                                                   OBJECT
    [                                                       {
      id: 6                                                     id: 6
      title: Title 6                                      6 ->  title: Title 6
      description: Description 6                                description: Description 6
      ,                                                         ,
      id: 33                                                    id: 33
      title: Title 33                                    33 ->  title: Title 33
      description: Description 33                               description: Description 33
    ]                                                       }
