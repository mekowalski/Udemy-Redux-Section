MERGING A LIST OF RECORDS
-Take an array of records(streams) from API and merge it all in State object
-This is a bit more challenging
-If there was an array to work with in the Reducer, it would be straightforward to kind of 'concat' the arrays
 together

-Since it's an object that's being worked with, need a different solution
