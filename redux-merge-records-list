MERGING A LIST OF RECORDS
-Take an array of records(streams) from API and merge it all in State object
-This is a bit more challenging
-If there was an array to work with in the Reducer, it would be straightforward to kind of 'concat' the arrays
 together

-Since it's an object that's being worked with, need a different solution

      ARRAY                                                   OBJECT
    [                                                       {
      id: 6                                                     id: 6
      title: Title 6                                      6 ->  title: Title 6
      description: Description 6                                description: Description 6
      ,                                                         ,
      id: 33                                                    id: 33
      title: Title 33                                    33 ->  title: Title 33
      description: Description 33                               description: Description 33
    ]                                                       }

    |---------------------->   mayKeys(streams, 'id') --->  |


-Left Side: Array meant to represent the response received from API when a list is returned
-In order for the list to be merged into object, use a function named mapKeys(), from Lodash
  ***mapKeys() will take an array and return an object***
-The keys for each new object is taken from each record inside the array

mapKeys(call the array, 'string')
mapKeys(streams, 'id')
-Call mapKeys, pass in an array of streams from API, and a string of id
-String will tell Lodash, for every one of the objects from the original array, use a key taken from id
 property
