FOLLOWING RESTFUL CONVENTIONS INSIDE APPLICATION

        ACTION        |       METHOD        |      ROUTE       |      RESPONSE
  ____________________|_____________________|__________________|____________________
      Records List    |         GET         |     /records     | Array of records
    Specific record   |         GET         |   /records/:id   | Single record
      Create record   |        POST         |     /records     | Single record
      Update record   |         PUT         |   /records/:id   | Single record
      Delete record   |       DELETE        |   /streams/:id   | Nothing

-The response is what the API Server returns when a request is made to it
-If RESTful convention is truly being followed, the response is pretty predictable
-Although there isn't a Component to show a list of records, edit a record, delete a record, then all Action
 Creators can be created altogether, when RESTful convention is followed

 eg: creating stream/list of streams/getting 1 stream/editing a stream/deleting a stream

-Eventually wire these up to their respective components when those are programmed
-In general this may work out
