-Chrome extension used for easily debugging Redux Store
-Helpful for using Redux Form, which is a bit tricky to work with
-Link: github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

-After installation(either with Chrome or Firefox), need to add a tiny bit up code in application to hook
 it up to Redux DevTools
-Import `compose`, `middleware` and all the green code from `1.2 Advanced store setup`
