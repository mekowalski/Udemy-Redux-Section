Redux DevTools Extension
-Chrome extension used for easily debugging Redux Store
-Helpful for using Redux Form, which is a bit tricky to work with
-Link: github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

-After installation(either with Chrome or Firefox), need to add a tiny bit up code in application to hook
 it up to Redux DevTools
-Import `compose`, `middleware` and all the green code from `1.2 Advanced store setup`

-The satellite icon for Redux DevTools will be present after connection
-Once icon is clicked it will display a grey-blue screen of inspecting the current application in the browser
-Two features that are frequently used with DevTools:
  1. State: shows current State inside Redux Store
  2. Left panel: list of all different actions that have been dispatched to Redux Store
    -Keeps track of the actions that have been dispatched(like a time line activity)
    -`jump` reflects the State inside of Store at that point in time, in the right panel
