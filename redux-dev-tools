REDUX DEVTOOLS EXTENSION
-Chrome extension used for easily debugging Redux Store
-Helpful for using Redux Form, which is a bit tricky to work with
-Link: github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

-After installation(either with Chrome or Firefox), need to add a tiny bit up code in application to hook
 it up to Redux DevTools
-Import `compose`, `middleware` and all the green code from `1.2 Advanced store setup`

-The satellite icon for Redux DevTools will be present after connection
-Once icon is clicked it will display a grey-blue screen of inspecting the current application in the browser
-Two features that are frequently used with DevTools:
  1. State: shows current State inside Redux Store
  2. Left panel: list of all different actions that have been dispatched to Redux Store
    -Keeps track of the actions that have been dispatched(like a time line activity)
    -`jump` reflects the State inside of Store at that point in time, in the right panel


DEBUG WITH REDUX DEVTOOLS
-When the application is running on the browser, go here:
localhost:3000?debug_session=<some_string>

-Redux DT will see that a debug session is trying to start
-Redux DT will then, automatically save all the data inside the Redux Store and persist it across refreshes
-Normally when application is refreshed, all the Redux Store data goes away, lost entirely
-This is useful for advanced feature development

-Once a debug session is done, remove the tag after localhost:3000
-Otherwise, Redux DT will continually throw the previous State into the Store
-This isn't helpful, particularly if a Reducer is changed to return another part of data
  eg: array instead of an object
-Continually running debug session will give errors because Redux DT is trying to throw data into the Store
 that is no longer valid
