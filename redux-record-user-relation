ASSOCIATING A RECORD WITH A USER

Current Stream Object
  {
    id:           | 6
    title:        | 'Title Six'
    description:  | 'Description of title six'
  }


Modified Stream Object
-When a stream object is created, it needs to have a user ID for association of who made that record
-User ID will come from Auth piece of State
-During OAuth process, the actual ID was present(seen in Redux DevTools)
-Take userId and attach it Stream Object when a stream is created with Create Form
  {
    id:           | 6
    title:        | 'Title Six'
    description:  | 'Description of title six'
    userId:       | 07301991
  }


Current CREATE RECORD action creator
-Passed the values of the form
-Take both form values and userId
-Make the 'post' request to the desired endpoint

-Need to get userId inside Action Creator
1. Call getState as 2nd argument in Action Creator
  eg: createStream Action Creator
