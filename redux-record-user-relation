ASSOCIATING A RECORD WITH A USER

Current Stream Object
  {
    id:           | 6
    title:        | 'Title Six'
    description:  | 'Description of title six'
  }


Modified Stream Object
-When a stream object is created, it needs to have a user ID for association of who made that record
-User ID will come from Auth piece of State
-During OAuth process, the actual ID was present(seen in Redux DevTools)
-Take userId and attach it Stream Object when a stream is created with Create Form
  {
    id:           | 6
    title:        | 'Title Six'
    description:  | 'Description of title six'
    userId:       | 07301991
  }


Current CREATE RECORD action creator
-Passed the values of the form
-Take both form values and userId
-Make the 'post' request to the desired endpoint

eg: createStream Action Creator
1. Call getState as 2nd argument in Action Creator
  - Need to get userId inside Action Creator
  export const createStream = (formValues) => {
    return async (dispatch, getState) => {
      const response = await streams.post('/streams', formValues)

      dispatch({ type: CREATE_STREAM, payload: response.data })
    }
  }

2. Destructure out userId within Action Creator
  - Destructure userId from calling getState.auth
  - getState returns the entire State object
  - Then access auth piece of sate(.auth) and just pluck out the userId
  export const createStream = (formValues) => {
    return async (dispatch, getState) => {
      const { userId } = getState().auth
      const response = await streams.post('/streams', formValues)

      dispatch({ type: CREATE_STREAM, payload: response.data })
    }
  }
