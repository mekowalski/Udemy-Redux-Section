VALIDATION OF FORM INPUTS
-Want to always ensure that a user will enter value into a Form Input
-This process of making sure input is entered is Validation
-Validation can be used to check for any type of element form
  eg: phone number format, email format, text format of string, etc

-Handling validations with Redux Forms is both hard and easy
-Hard: a few moving pieces and a little bit of "magic"
-Easy: as long as the pattern is learned, doing validations is quick


VALIDATION PROCESS DIAGRAM
-Form is going to be validated by Redux Form almost every millisecond of the day
-Essentially every single time the Form is rendered on screen
-And every single time the user interacts with the Form
***refer to streams-app***

                        Form is initially rendered OR user interacts with it
