OBJECT-BASED REDUCERS

-Reducer Structure Option #1
-Common(and most current way I've created) Reducers, for a list of records to maintain
-Always returned an array of objects
streamsReducer ---> [ stream | stream | stream | stream ]


-Take a different approach to maintain an array of objects
-Reducer Structure Option #2
  eg:
  streamsReducer ---> {
                        3:  | stream w/ ID 3
                        27: | stream w/ ID 27
                        39: | stream w/ ID 39
                      }
