Dispatch is part of Redux Library, therefore that doesn't have to be written from scratch
Skip over Dispatch and implement Reducers

-Reducers: write a few function to model a Dept in the Insurance Co
1. Claims Reducer
2. Accounting Reducer
3. Policies Reducer

-Each Reducer will be called with an Action(Form)
-Reducer will inspect the Action(Form) and decide whether or not it needs to modify data based on Action
-Each Reducer is passed 2 pieces of arguments in the same order
  1. Whatever existing Data from Data Bank belongs to the Dept
  2. Action(Form)

eg: Claims History
//REDUCERS(Departments)
const claimsHistory = (oldClaims, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'CREATE_CLAIM') {
    //we care about this action (Form)
  }
  //then we don't care about the action (Form)
}
