Now that Action Creators, Actions & Reducers are built, wire them together into a single object name Store
STORE: collection of different Reducers and Action Creators
-The previously create Reducers and Action Creators have NOT referenced the Redux library whatsoever
-The vast amount of written Redux code is going to be normal code with normal functions, arrays & objects
-Only at small, specific points will Redux even be referenced directly

console.log(Redux) =>
{createStore: ƒ, combineReducers: ƒ, bindActionCreators: ƒ, applyMiddleware: ƒ, compose: ƒ, …}

const { createStore, combineReducers } = Redux

const departments = combineReducers({
  accounting: accounting,
  claimsHistory: claimsHistory,
  policies: policies
})
//these are ALL the Reducers

const store = createStore(departments)

store; //Represents Redux app, contains all the Reducers and all State/Data produced by Reducers

-first create Action to pass to Dispatch
const action = createPolicy('Malind', 30)

-store.dispatch() is Form Receiver that makes the copies
-Just like the original Form Receiver, dispatch makes copies and sends to Reducers
-When Action is passed to store.dispatch(), the Action will forward to each Reducer
-Each Reducer function ran and processed that Action(Form)
-This will incrementally modify how the State of the company looks all contained in the Store
store.dispatch(action);


-Function that gets entire Company Data Bank
-store.getState() essentially get all assembled bank of data, get access to entire Store information
store.getState()
console.log(store.getState()) =>
>{accounting: 130, claimsHistory: Array(0), policies: Array(1)}
  accounting: 130
  >claimsHistory: []
  >policies: ["Malind"]


Create a collection of the Company Data Bank
eg:
store.dispatch(createPolicy('Kristopher', 60));
store.dispatch(createPolicy('Ryan', 66));
store.dispatch(createPolicy('Christine', 33));
=>
>{accounting: 259, claimsHistory: Array(0), policies: Array(3)}
  accounting: 259
  >claimsHistory: []
  >policies: (3) ["Kristopher", "Ryan", "Christine"]

*Three Policies for Kristopher, Ryan and Christine
*Total amount of 259 (100+60+66+33)
*No claims yet created/filed
