Now that Action Creators, Actions & Reducers are built, wire them together into a single object name Store
STORE: collection of different Reducers and Action Creators

console.log(Redux) =>
{createStore: ƒ, combineReducers: ƒ, bindActionCreators: ƒ, applyMiddleware: ƒ, compose: ƒ, …}

const { createStore, combineReducers } = Redux

const departments = combineReducers({
  accounting: accounting,
  claimsHistory: claimsHistory,
  policies: policies
})

const store = createStore(departments)

store; //Represents Redux app, contains all the Reducers and all State/Data produced by Reducers

//first create Action to pass to Dispatch
const action = createPolicy('Malind', 30)

//Just like the original Form Receiver, dispatch makes copies and sends to Reducers
store.dispatch(action);
