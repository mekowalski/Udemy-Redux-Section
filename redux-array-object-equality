EQUALITY OF ARRAYS AND OBJECTS

Arrays
const numbers = [3, 6, 9]

-In JS, easily compare equality between 2 values with ===
-Number and strings are more a value comparison(is the number 3 equal to the VALUE of 3?)
3 === 3 => true
'hey' === 'hey' => true
3 !== 1 => true
3 !== 3 => false (because 3 is equal to 3)

-Comparison operator can also be used on arrays and objects
numbers === numbers => true

-When comparing arrays/objects, JS is checking to see it is a reference to the exact array in memory
-NOT the content of the array
eg:
numbers === [3, 6, 9] => false
*because comparison isn't between array content(as the are the exact same)
*comparison is between whether or not the numbers is referencing the exact array in memory
