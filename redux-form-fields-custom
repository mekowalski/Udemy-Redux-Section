CUSTOMIZING FORM FIELDS
-Currently the input that is shown on the screen is very BLAND and UGLY
-No label, inputs are right next to each other, not informative enough for use to know what's going on
-Rather than just returning a Text Input, return an entire blob of JSX(different elements)
  eg: renderInput()
  renderInput(formProps) {
    return (
      <div className='field'>
        <label></label>
        <input
          onChange={formProps.input.onChange}
          value={formProps.input.value}
        />
      <div>
    )
  }

  ***label for telling user what the input actually represents***


-renderInput() is called twice(title, description)
-When label is used, need to make sure to associate which Field is being worked on
-To get that appropriate Field, add a new prop to both Field elements
  eg: Field props
  <Field name='title' component={this.renderInput} label='Enter Title' />
  <Field name='title' component={this.renderInput} label='Enter Description' />
