CUSTOMIZING FORM FIELDS
-Currently the input that is shown on the screen is very BLAND and UGLY
-No label, inputs are right next to each other, not informative enough for use to know what's going on
-Rather than just returning a Text Input, return an entire blob of JSX(different elements)
  eg: renderInput()
  renderInput(formProps) {
    return (
      <div className='field'>
        <label></label>
        <input
          onChange={formProps.input.onChange}
          value={formProps.input.value}
        />
      <div>
    )
  }

  ***label for telling user what the input actually represents***
