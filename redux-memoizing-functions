Lodash Library: Utility JS library with a ton of functions built-in that make J a bit simpler to write

MEMOIZE FUNCTION
-When memoize is used on a function, the original function only runs 1 time
-The function will run again with a new argument called on it but again will not run a 2nd time

-This is helpful for calling an Action Creator with a unique ID, 1 time
