CREATE A RECORD WITH REST CONVENTION

-Current connect():
export default connect(null, { createStream })(formWrapped)

-mapStateToProps is not yet defined

-Inside Component, within the handler
-Whenever a user submits a Form, make sure to call action creator with all form values
  eg: onSubmit()
  onSubmit(formValues) {
    this.props.createStream(formValues)
  }


1. When user tries to submit form, inputs will be validated
2. If inputs are valid, then call onSubmit()
3. onSubmit() will call Action Creator: createStream
4. createStream will attempt to make a POST request over to API server and create a new stream
